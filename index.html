				<h3 id="introduction">Manga, Manhwa & Manhua, Explained</h3>
				<p>In recent years, the international popularity of manga has led to an increased interest towards manhwa and manhua. Manga, manhwa and manhua sound the same, and generally speaking, are similar in artwork and layout, which can result in accidentally categorizing these comics as Japanese in origin. But, there are some subtle <em>but important</em> differences between the three that make all the difference.</p>

				<h4 id="manga">What is Manga?</h4>
				<p><b>Manga</b> is an umbrella term for a wide variety of comic books and graphic novels originally produced and published in Japan. Unlike American comic books, which are usually printed in full color, Japanese manga are almost always published in black and white. Full-color prints are often only used for special releases.</p>
				<p>Japanese manga is read right-to-left rather than left-to-right, which is the norm for English language publications. This can take some getting used to if you have only ever read English publications,  but you will hardly notice once youâ€™ve practiced enough.</p>
				<p>Example of manga.</p>

				<h4 id="manhwa">What is Manhwa?</h4>
				<p><b>Manhwa</b> is the general Korean term for comics and print cartoons. Outside of Korea, the term usually refers specifically to South Korean comics. South Korea is now one of the major producers of comics. Manhwa has been influenced by the dramatic modern history of Korea, resulting in a diversity of forms and genres, including a mainstream style same as manga. Distinctive manhwa can be found in editorial comic strips, artistically-oriented works, and webcomics serials.</p>
				<p>Many also refer to them as webtoons due to the popular website of the same name. Manhwas are fully colored and filled with panels that look like paintings.</p>
				<p>Example of manhwa.</p>

				<h4 id="manhua">What is Manhua?</h4>
				<p><b>Manhua</b> is a term that describes comics made in China, Taiwan, or Hong Kong. Manhuas are fully colored and use panels in a single-issue format.</p>
				<p>Usually, manhua has unique genres, such as <em>Wuxia</em> (martial arts stories) and <em>Xianxia</em> (fantasy and magic stories). Among all the comics, manhwa is the only one that has not embraced its rich culture and thrived on it.</p>
